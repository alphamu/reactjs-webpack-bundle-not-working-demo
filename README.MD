# ReactJS project that does not work with  webpack-dev-server

A broken react project that demostrates that webpack-dev-server is not automatically bundling and showing changes after a file is edited. A fixed version of this project is on the `fixed` branch.

For more information on this project, [see my medium post](https://medium.com/@ali.muzaffar/when-using-react-js-webpack-dev-server-does-not-bundle-c2d340b0a3e8).
